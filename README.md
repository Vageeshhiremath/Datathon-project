# House Price Prediction Data Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis and linear regression model for house price prediction.
## Key Features:
*   **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Handled missing values (median imputation) and removed outliers (IQR method).
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Performed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and normality checks.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Confirmed that proximity to the MRT and number of convenience stores significantly impact house prices.
*   **Modeling:** Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict price per unit area, achieving an R-squared of ~0.62.
*   **Deliverables:** Includes a detailed analysis report and a runnable Jupyter Notebook (`6.ipynb`).
